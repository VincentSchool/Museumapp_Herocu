        "uitleg" : "At first glance, California artist Steven Harrington’s latest exhibition, Magic Hour, is an over-the-top world of poppy colors, wild characters, and psychedelic dreams. For many viewers this first glance will be enough. It’s a fun, immersive world of paintings, drawings, and sculptures that will compel and delight. But look a little deeper and viewers might find something more—further contemplation on the artist’s lifelong exploration of balance, nature, musings on creative evolution, personification of the subconscious, and a little bit of chaos encroaching upon this happy, colorful world.",
        "uitleg2" : "Magic Hour is a journey through the last few years of the artist’s life—vibrant encapsulations of personal moments that also translate to simple themes all viewers can connect to. Just as the magic hour straddles time between day and night, these works walk the line between lighthearted playfulness and something a bit more nuanced, image for the sake of image and icons that inspire narrative. “At the end of the day,” Harrington says, “it’s about sitting down in front of a piece of paper and freely exploring.” Bold, flat colors, abstract hints of nostalgia, and familiar yet surprising forms all invite the viewer in. What happens then is anyone’s guess.",
        "uitleg3" : "This exhibition is generously supported by Nike. Nike and Harrington have partnered to present a new, small capsule collection of clothing and footwear, the latest in a years-long collaboration. The launch of sneakers and apparel, all featuring Harrington’s unmistakable designs, will coincide with the showing of Magic Hour."

        "uitleg" : "Dutch artist Parra (1976) is best known for his curved post-Pop imagery, highly saturated colours, vibrant hand-drawn letters and worlds inhabited by hybrid, surreal characters. Celebrated by galleries and championed by an underground following from the outset, Parra has quickly become a respected and eclectic artist worldwide. Working across drawing, painting, animation and sculpture, Parra creates an enigmatic and instantly recognisable style that defies easy categorisation. Parra is cofounder of cult apparel label ByParra and a member of electronic music groups Le Le and Mich. Parra lives and works in Amsterdam, The Netherlands."

        "uitleg" : "When Haring arrived in New York, it was home to a thriving underground art scene. Haring befriended fellow emerging artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Kenny Scharf, who shared his interest in the colorful and transgressive graffiti art of the city's streets. Haring and these other artists organized exhibitions at downtown nightclubs and other alternative locations, where art, music and fashion all came together in a dynamic mix.",
        "uitleg2" : "Beyond the clubs, Haring began using the city as his canvas. Riding the subway, he noticed the black paper rectangles of empty advertising panels on station walls; using white chalk, he began filling these black panels with simple, quickly drawn pictures. His signature images included dancing figures, a radiant baby (a crawling infant emitting rays of light), a barking dog, a flying saucer, large hearts, and figures with televisions for heads. These graffiti drawings attracted the attention of New York commuters, as well as the city authorities: Haring was arrested for vandalism on numerous occasions."

        "uitleg" : "Ryan Travis Christian’s 1990s suburban Chicago upbringing offered up absurd experiences, which he uses as fuel for the surreal personal narratives in his pop-culture-influenced graphite drawings. Impacted by Chicago-style figuration, Christian focuses on the paradoxical relationship between childish cartoons and ominous messages, musing on the technological and material obsolescence of his inspiration. Vintage political cartoons and hand-drawn animation influence Christian’s detailed vignettes—namely from Ub Iwerks, George Condo, and the Hairy Who—Christian comes to terms with his sources’ sordid pasts while embracing their richness and flavor. Christian carefully and densely layers graphite to reveal high contrast graphics and dizzying patterns; wiggly figures are rendered in slow motion, living among hazy landscapes and melting fences. He exposes the untidy lifestyle of contemporary humanity through a vast array of topics and imagery; the economy, the environment, gender, class, hope, and doubt are contemplated with drugs, heavy petting, alcohol, violence, depression, death, and the afterlife. Christian’s recent work has expanded to comment on current nationwide and worldwide crises: his historical precedents become mirrors reflecting the common concerns of the present. Text is prevalent in Christian’s work, coming mostly from personal notes-to-self about conversations or encounters that have stuck around long enough to remain relevant to him and keep up to the caliber of his source.",
